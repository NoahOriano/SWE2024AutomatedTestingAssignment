NOTES AND REMARKS

Jacoco
- Could not get Jacoco to properly run with the project, so while the coverage report exists, it is not accurate.
- The coverage report and Jacoco file are still included in an unmodified state.

Testing Approach
- The testing approach was split into two parts: requirements and iterative tests for edge cases
- This proved to be helpful since only four out of the six errors were caught by the requirements tests
- The iterative tests were able to catch the remaining two errors
- Without the requirements tests, the iterative test output would have taken longer to understand and debug
- The testing for requirements also helps shape and ensure the correctness of the iterative tests which are more complex
